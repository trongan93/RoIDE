This is offical source code of my recently research article:

**Trong-An Bui**, P. -J. Lee, J. Liobe, V. Barzdenas and D. Udris, "Region of Interest-Focused Dynamic Enhancement (RoIDE) for Satellite Images," in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 63, pp. 1-14, 2025, Art no. 5606914, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2024.3525411. 

The main file of training RoI model is RoiDE_train.py and the inference process is in the RoIDE_test.py file.
